# Power BI Contact_Center_Data_Analysis_Project
Performance Analysis For Contact Center Dataset 
## Project Description
This project is a comprehensive data analysis of a contact center, designed to provide a holistic view of the call center's performance metrics and trends. The dashboard showcases key performance indicators (KPIs) that are crucial in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the call center's operations.

### The main KPIs are:

1. Overall Customer Satisfaction: This metric gauges the level of satisfaction among customers who engage with the call center for assistance.
2. Number Of Calls Handled: This KPI identifies trends and peak periods by analyzing call volume patterns throughout the Quarter, week, or month.
3. Average Handling Time: This KPI quantifies the average time agents spend on the call, indicating responsiveness.
4. Agent Performance Quadrant: This visual insight portrays agent efficiency and workload distribution by plotting agents' performance based on their average handle time (talk duration) and the number of calls answered.
